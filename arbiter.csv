    Cortana , [after seeing Gravemind]  What... is that?
    Gravemind , I... I am a monument to all your sins...
    Master Chief , Relax. I'd rather not piss this thing off.
    Arbiter , Demon!
    Gravemind , This one is machine and nerve and has its mind concluded; this one is but flesh and faith and is the more deluded...
    Arbiter ," Kill me or release me, parasite. But do not waste my time with talk!"
    Gravemind , There is much talk... and I have listened through rock and metal and time... Now I shall talk and you shall listen...
    Prophet of Regret ," And I am the Prophet of Regret, Council of most high hierarch of the Covenant!"
    Prophet of Regret , Stay where you are! Nothing can be done until my sermon is complete!
    Prophet of Regret ," Of all the objects that our Lords left behind, there are none so worthless as these Oracles! They know nothing of the Great Journey!"
    Gravemind ," This one's Containment, and this one's Great Journey are the same... Your prophets have promised you freedom from a doomed existence, but you will find no salvation on this ring. Those that built this place knew what they wrought. Do not mistake their intent or all will perish as they did before."
    Master Chief , This thing is right; Halo is a weapon. Your prophets are making a big mistake.
    Arbiter ," Your ignorance already destroyed one of the sacred rings, Demon. It shall not harm another!"
    Gravemind ," If you will not hear the truth, then I will show it to you."
    Gravemind , You will search one likely spot...
    Gravemind ," And you will search another. Fate may have placed us as foes, but this ring will make us brothers."
    SpecOps Leader ," When we joined the Covenant, we took an oath!"
    SpecOps Elites , According to our station! All without exception!
    SpecOps Leader ," On the blood of our fathers, on the blood of our sons, we swore to uphold the Covenant!"
    SpecOps Elites , Even to our dying breath!
    SpecOps Leader , Those who would break this oath are heretics! Worthy of neither pity nor mercy!
    SpecOps Elites , We shall grind them into dust!
    SpecOps Leader , And continue our march to glorious salvation!
    SpecOps Leader ," This armor suits you, Arbiter. But it cannot hide that mark."
    Arbiter , Nothing ever will.
    SpecOps Leader ," You are the Arbiter. The will of the Prophets. But these are my Elites. Their lives matter to me, yours does not."
    Arbiter , That makes two of us.
    Arbiter , [standing before the heirarchs and the counsel]  There was only one ship.
    Prophet of Truth , One? Are you sure?
    Arbiter ," Yes. They called it the ""Pillar of Autumn""."
    Prophet of Mercy , Why was it not destroyed with the rest of their fleet?
    Arbiter , It fled as we set fire to their planet. I followed with all the ships in my command.
    Prophet of Regret ," When you first saw Halo, were you blinded by its magesty?"
    Arbiter , Blinded?
    Prophet of Regret , Paralyzed? Dumbstruck?
    Arbiter , No!
    Prophet of Regret ," Yet the humans were able to evade your ships, land on the sacred ring, and descrate it with their filty footsteps!"
    Arbiter ," Noble hierarchs, surely you understand that once the parasite attacked..."
    Prophet of Mercy , There will be order in this counsel!
    Prophet of Truth ," [gestures the crowd to be silent]  You were right to focus your attention on The Flood, but this Demon? This Master Chief?"
    Arbiter ," By the time I learned of the Demon's intent, there was nothing I could do!"
    Prophet of Regret ," [whispering]  Prophet of Truth, this has gone on long enough! Make an example of this bungler! The Counsel demands it!"
    Prophet of Truth ," [to the Arbiter]  You are one of our most treasured instruments. Long have you lead your fleet with honor and distinction. But, your inability to safeguard Halo was a colossal failure."
    Counselman , Nay! It was heresy!
    Arbiter , I will continue my campaign against the humans!
    Prophet of Truth ," No, you will not."
    Prophet of Truth ," The Great Journey is about to begin. But when it does, the weight of your heresy will stay your feet... and you shall be left behind."
    Tartarus ," [bringing the soon to be Arbiter to the Prophets]  Noble Prophets of Truth and Mercy, I have brought the incompetent."
    Prophet of Truth ," You may leave, Tartarus."
    Tartarus , But...
    Prophet of Truth , And take your Brutes with you.
    Tartarus , [disappointed]  Release the prisoner.
    Prophet of Truth ," The Council decided to have you hung by your entrails, and your corpse paraded through the city. But ultimately, the terms of your execution are up to me."
    Arbiter , I am already dead.
    Prophet of Truth , Indeed. Do you know where we are?
    Arbiter , The Mausoleum of the Arbiter.
    Prophet of Truth ," Yes. Here lies the vanguard of the Great Journey. Each Arbiter, created and consumed in times of extraordinary crisis."
    Prophet of Mercy ," The Taming of the Hunters, the Grunt Rebellion, were it not for the Arbiters, the Covenant would have fallen long ago!"
    Arbiter ," Even on my knees, I do not belong in their presence..."
    Prophet of Truth ," Halo's destruction was your error, and you rightly bear the blame. But the Council was, overzealous. We know you are no heretic. THIS is the TRUE face of heresy."
    Prophet of Truth ," One who would subdue our faith, and induce rebellion within the High Council."
    Heretic Leader ," Our Prophets are FALSE! Open your eyes, my brothers! They would use the faith of our forefathers to bring ruin to us all! The Great Journey is..."
    Prophet of Truth ," This Heretic, and those who follow him, must be silenced."
    Arbiter ," What use am I now? I can no longer command ships, lead troops into battle..."
    Prophet of Truth ," Not as you are, no. But become the Arbiter, and you shall be set free of this heresy with our blessing."
    Arbiter , What of the council?
    Prophet of Mercy ," The tasks you will take as the Arbiter are perilous, suicidal. You will DIE. As each Arbiter before you has died. The Council will have their corpse."
    Arbiter ," [walks to Arbiter armour, puts on helmet, and turns to Prophets]  What would you have your Arbiter do?"
    Arbiter , Those that built the rings? What happened to the Forerunners?
    Arbiter ," Tartarus, the Prophets have betrayed us."
    Tartarus ," NO, Arbiter! The Great Journey has begun, and the Brutes, not the Elites, shall be the Prophets' escort!"
    Tartarus ," [after the Arbiter captures the Index, Keyes, and Sgt. Johnson]  Excellent work, Arbiter! The hierarchs will be pleased!"
    Arbiter , The icon is my responsibility.
    Tartarus ," *Was* your responsibility. Now, it is mine. A bloody fate awaits you and the rest of your incompetent race, and I, Tartarus, chieftain of the Brutes, will see to it."
    Arbiter ," When the Prophets learn of this, they will take your head!"
    Tartarus , When they learn? Ha ha ha ha ha ha! Fool! They ordered me to do it.
    Miranda Keyes , [after the ring is shut down]  What's that?
    Miranda Keyes , What's it doing?
    Miranda Keyes , Communicating with what?
    Miranda Keyes , Show me.
    Miranda Keyes , Remote activation? From here?
    Miranda Keyes , Then where? Where would somebody go to activate the other rings?
    Arbiter ," And where, Oracle, is that?"
    Arbiter , The human who killed the Prophet of Regret... who was it?
    Tartarus , Who do you think?
    Arbiter , The demon is here?
    Tartarus , Why? Looking for a little payback?
    Arbiter , Retrieving the Icon is my only concern.
    Tartarus , [chuckles]  Of course...
    SpecOps Leader ," [to Arbiter]  You are the Arbiter, the will of the Prophets. But these are my Elites, their lives matter to me - yours does not."
    Arbiter , That makes two of us.
    SpecOps Elites ," When we joined the Covenant, we took an oath!"
    SpecOps Elites , According to our station! All without exception!

    SpecOps Elites , Even to our dying breath!
    SpecOps Leader , Those who would break this oath are heretics! Worthy of neither pity nor mercy!
    SpecOps Elites , We shall grind them into dust! Wipe them as excrement from our boots!
    SpecOps Leader , And continue our march to glorious salvation!
    SpecOps Leader ," This armour suits you, Arbiter. But it cannot hide that mark."
    Arbiter , Nothing ever will.
